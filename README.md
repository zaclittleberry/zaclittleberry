### Hello Humans

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! :)

Most of my day-to-day contributions are in a separate private account for my employer.

ðŸ‘‰ My ongoing public personal company/side-project contributions are on <a href="https://gitlab.com/gazedev" target="_blank">my Gaze.Dev GitLab profile</a>.

Most of my work in my Gaze.Dev profile is around housingdb.org/pittsburghhousing.org. This is an long running side project to help the rental community in Pittsburgh/Allegheny County and beyond with tools that are all open source. Most everything is built as decoupled apps and APIs communicating with JSON over REST. I built my own deploy system to update the containerized apps to a server kindly provided by CMU's CREATE Lab.

I'm really happy that <a href="https://github.com/communitybridge/easycla/graphs/contributors?author=zaclittleberry&from=2017-03-10&to=2018-03-10&type=c">my work at The Linux Foundation working on what became EasyCLA</a> was eventually open sourced.
